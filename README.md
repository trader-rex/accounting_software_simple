# accounting_software_simple
A simple accounting software in python with sqlite3.
This is un accounting software according to my idea.
There are two .py files.
The xtry.py file are the methods for imputing the important data for assets, capital, liabilities, profits and expenses from the user.
Same methods then proceed the data to the accounting software which is the other .py file.
This is very simple project and there isn't vast majorities of options for accounting classes but the main idea still stands right.
Other accounting classes options could be writtten in the code and according to the needs of individual accounting policies.
The code is written using python list, tuples, dictionaries, strings and integer data type. 
Data storage is performed usig sqlite3 module.
